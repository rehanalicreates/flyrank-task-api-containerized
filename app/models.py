"""
Pydantic models (schemas) for the Task resource.

We separate these into three shapes on purpose:
- TaskCreate:  what the client sends when creating a task (no id, no timestamps)
- TaskUpdate:  what the client sends when updating a task (all fields optional,
               so a client can update just one field without resending everything)
- TaskResponse: what the API sends back (includes server-generated fields)

Keeping these separate is a small thing now, but it's the same principle behind
"layered architecture" — the shape of data coming IN doesn't have to match the
shape of data going OUT, and the API contract stays stable even if internal
storage changes later.
