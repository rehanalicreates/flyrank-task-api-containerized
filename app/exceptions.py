"""
Custom exceptions for the Task domain.

Why bother with custom exceptions instead of just raising HTTPException everywhere?
Because the repository layer (repository.py) shouldn't know anything about HTTP —
it's just data storage logic. It raises a domain-specific error (TaskNotFoundError),
and the API layer (main.py) is the only place that translates that into an HTTP
status code. This separation means the repository could be reused in a CLI tool,
a background job, or a different framework without dragging FastAPI along with it.
